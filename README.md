# Gradient Descent Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a gradient descent algorithm for linear regression using the `make_regression` dataset. The notebook provides insights into gradient descent, model building, and evaluation for linear regression.
## About Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to train machine learning models, including linear regression. It plays a crucial role in finding the optimal parameters (coefficients) for a model that minimize the error (cost) between its predictions and the actual target values.

### How Gradient Descent Works

1. **Initialization**: Gradient descent starts with an initial guess for the model's parameters. These parameters are often initialized with random values.

2. **Loss Function**: A loss function (also known as a cost function) is defined to measure how well the model's predictions match the actual target values. In linear regression, the common loss function is Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. **Gradient Calculation**: The algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each model parameter. The gradient represents the direction and magnitude of the steepest increase in the loss.

4. **Parameter Update**: The parameters are updated iteratively in the direction opposite to the gradient. This step is crucial in minimizing the loss. The learning rate, a hyperparameter, controls the size of each parameter update.

5. **Convergence**: Steps 3 and 4 are repeated iteratively until the loss converges to a minimum value, indicating that the model has learned the optimal parameters.

### Key Concepts

- **Learning Rate**: The learning rate determines the step size in each parameter update. A small learning rate may result in slow convergence, while a large one can cause overshooting and divergence.

- **Batch Gradient Descent**: In batch gradient descent, the entire dataset is used to compute the gradient in each iteration. It is computationally intensive for large datasets.

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: SGD updates parameters based on a single data point at a time. It can be faster but may have more erratic convergence.

- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Mini-batch gradient descent combines the advantages of both batch and SGD by updating parameters using a small random subset (mini-batch) of the data in each iteration.

Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization technique used not only in linear regression but also in various machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. Understanding gradient descent is essential for training and fine-tuning models effectively.
